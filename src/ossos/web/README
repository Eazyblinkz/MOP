Purpose
-------
A Pyramid-framework website front-end communicating via SQLAlchemy to a PostgreSQL database: it presents the metadata
of the CFHT observations made for OSSOS.

The database is populated from the raw data and processing products stored in CADC's VOSpace.

Installation
------------
development.ini and ossos.overview.__init__.py are the primary files for setup and configuration of ports,
database addresses, included packages and the like.
Also, ossos.overview.OssuaryTable points to the local installation of your postgres database. This location needs to
match what's in the development.ini.

Development
-----------
Each page of the website lives in a separate package, all within the 'web' namespace.

To add a new webpage or JS, named 'newpage', create a package and hook it in to the namespace and the framework:
- Create a new folder within web (this extends the namespace automatically)::
  web/web/newpage
- Copy the __init__.py from any package except overview, eg. web/field_obs/__init__.py
- Alter the .add_route() in the new __init__.py's includeme() to appropriate names to match those of the @view_config()
decorators on the view defs in /web/web/newpage/newpage.py. The second parameter dictates the url path
and can be set accordingly. This hooks the module to the framework. You need to keep the .scan(__name__) in place,
otherwise the routes don't get picked up.
- In web/web/overview/__init__.py, add ::
  config.include('web.newmodule')
to the list of .include() statements, before the config.scan().
- Add any new packages your new page needs in its Python scripts to ossos-pipeline/web/setup.py's install_requires
- Run ::
  cd ossos-pipeline/web
  python setup.py install
and restart the server.
