These are the installation instructions for 
Matt Holman's version of the search routines
for the CFHT pipe-line.

Credit for outside code.
E. Bertin et al for Sextractor2.1.6
M. Richmond for the match routines, based on the Valdes et al
triangle matching algorithm
D. Mink for wcstools-2.9.3

1. Unpack the tar-ball
tar xvf pipematt-tar
cd pipematt
make clean
make all

2. Install sextractor

Here you'll want to check that a $HOME/bin directory
exists.  This is just to avoid changing the sextractor
Makefile, which has that for a destination directory for
some things.

On makani needed to add /usr/ccs/bin to path in order to get ar.

cd sextractor2.1.6/source
make clean
make SEXMACHINE=linuxpc
cp sex ../..
cd ../..

3. Install match
gzcat match-tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd match
make clean
make all
cd ..

On a Sun this work without complaint.
On mckennit I get a complaint about the test failing, but
actually the output looks fine.  I am ignoring the
warnings for now.

4. Install wcstools
gunzip wcstools-2.9.3.tar.gz
tar xvf wcstools-2.9.3.tar
cd wcstools-2.9.3
make all (on non-Solaris machines)
make -f Makefile.solaris all (on Solaris machines)
cd bin
cp gethead ../..
cp skycoor ../..
cd ../..
\rm -rf wcstools-2.9.3
gzip wcstools-2.9.3.tar

Getting some warnings on Linux machine.
I am ignoring those for now.

5. Edit sextractor configuration files
cd config
Edit fnd.sex to make sure that pathnames
to the various files are correct.
Select either the default convolution mask or a
gaussian convolution mask (Now set).

cd ..

6. Copy or move executables into architecture-dependent
directory.

These are the files that are needed:

bright
convert_mjd
convert_radec
cr_elim
gethead
gettime-exp
match (executable in match directory)
non_stationary
search
sex
skycoor
trans

7. Edit the perl command files so that perl is found
which perl
edit step1matt
edit step2matt
edit step3matt
Check for and adjust basedir and matchdir definitions.

chmod 755 step*

8. Test things

cp ../../data/*fits .

step1matt -f fkb1 -w 5.0 -t 1.3 -m 30000
step1matt -f fkb2 -w 5.0 -t 1.3 -m 30000
step1matt -f fkb3 -w 5.0 -t 1.3 -m 30000
step2matt -f1 fkb1 -f2 fkb2 -f3 fkb3
step3matt -f1 fkb1 -f2 fkb2 -f3 fkb3 -rn 0.5 -rx 20.0 -a -45.0 -w 50.0
