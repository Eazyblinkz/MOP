The mops-historic pipeline is legacy Perl, Fortran 77, C and maybe other things.

The OSSOS pipeline is primarily Python-based, with legacy code incorporated: Python v. 3.2.3 at this stage. 3.3.0 support is still a bit rarer, so 3.2 for now.
http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/
Documentation follows which style guide?

PostgreSQL as the backend database.
Python db interaction toolkit: SQLAlchemy rather than the more lightweight Django.
useful comparison advice: http://jmoiron.net/blog/about-sqlalchemy-and-djangos-orm/
SQLAlchemy 0.8 installed as it doesn't yet play with Python 3.
Now: where can I put the db that it can be accessed by the interface layer? VOSpace?

Python packages with (at least) 3.2 support:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib 
astropy is now mature at 0.2 in Python 3.2, 3.3, so we can use it as well. Includes pyfits, asciitable, vo.table, pywcs. http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/stability.html
http://deimos.astro.columbia.edu/scratch/astropy.pdf
jplephem
marstime
ephem
sgp4
pyraf

astLib rather than ephem? ah: astropy.coordinates now handles most of what we were using ephem for (pretty/readable coordinates).
